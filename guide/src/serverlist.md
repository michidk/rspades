# Serverlist

The semi-official server list can be browsed on [build & shoot](https://www.buildandshoot.com/servers/).

The data can be parsed in the `JSON` format from [http://services.buildandshoot.com/serverlist.json](http://services.buildandshoot.com/serverlist.json).
It does not directly contain IP addresses. They have to be decoded by following [the algorithm](aos-urls.md) first.
